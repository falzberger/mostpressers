This repository dedicates itself to the [website of the Most Pressers](https://mostpressers.at).

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
